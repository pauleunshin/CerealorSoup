# Cereal or Soup
Creating a script that will eventually attempt to discern between cereal and soup

Goals:

1. Create a script that can download an image given a search query
2. Have the script save that image to the github repo
3. Make the script ask how many images to save
4. Name and save folder of search query
5. Alternative command: Clear saved photos (5gb github limit so /shrug)

6. Image recognition bit
6a. Needs to recognize between cereal or soup
6b. Should also discern if its neither option
7. New script/bot that will take an image input and decide if its cereal or soup
** Thoughts: I feel like the bot will have trouble discerning even with training. Maybe a better comparison topic would be hotdog/hamburg?
